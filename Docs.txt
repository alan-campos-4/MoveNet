###### Pose detection ######

	/scripts/main.py
performs the most basic form of pose detection using the MoveNet model with TensorFlow on a single camera.

	/scripts/main_stereo.py
is a modified version that performs pose detection on both cameras simultaneously.

	/scripts/main_stereo_avg.py
is a modified version that calcultes the average of every keypoint in the pose detection obtained from both cameras
and draws the edges between them. 




###### Calibration / Rectification ######

	/script/calibration/visualize rectification.py
that uses the parameters	/params/stereo_params_undistort.npz
created with the script		/script/calibration/createCalib_undistort.py
we can see the difference between the rectified and unaltered camera.
However, the resulting image is cropped on the sides. And the difference is not very noticeable.

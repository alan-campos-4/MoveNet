###### Pose detection ######

	/scripts/main.py
performs basic pose estimation using the MoveNet model with TensorFlow on a single camera.

	/scripts/main_depth.py and /scripts/main_depth_1.py
is a combination of /scripts/main.py and /scripts/disparity/vpi_and_disparity.py that calculates pose estimation and uses disparity to determine the distance of each point from the camera. 

	/scripts/main_depth.py
is a combination of /scripts/main.py and /scripts/disparity/vpi_and_disparity.py that calculates pose estimation alongside disparity from the same stereo camera feed. 

	/scripts/main_stereo.py
is a modified version of main.py that performs pose estimation on both cameras simultaneously.

	/scripts/main_stereo_avg.py
is a modified version of main.py that calcultes the average of every keypoint in the pose detection obtained from both cameras and draws the edges between them.





###### Calibration / Rectification ######

	/scripts/calibration/visualize_rectification.py
uses the parameters		/params/stereo_params_undistort.npz
created with the script	/scripts/calibration/createCalib_undistort.py
we can see the difference between the rectified and unaltered camera. After adjusting the camera focus and taking a new set of pictures the change is clear.

	/scripts/disparity/vpi_and_disparity.py
uses the parameters		/params/stereo_params_undistort.npz
to obtain both camera feeds and create a disparity map from them each frame.
Currently the most visually clear.
